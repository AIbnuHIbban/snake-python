### Snake Game
"Snake" that was created using the Pygame library in Python. The objective of the game is to move the snake to eat food and avoid hitting the walls or its own body. Every time the snake eats food, its length will increase and the player will gain points. The food in this game has three different colors - red, blue, and purple - each giving a different number of points.

This program was created as a fun exercise to learn the basics of Pygame and simple game programming concepts.

### How to Run
1. Make sure that Python and Pygame are installed on your computer.
2. Download and save the snake.py file in the directory of your choice.
3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the snake.py file.
4. Type "python snake.py" or "python3 snake.py" in the terminal or command prompt to run the program.
